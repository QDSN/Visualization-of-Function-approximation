# Visualization-of-Function-approximation
Visualize how y=f(x) is approximated by the multilayer perceptron through training.
## Usage
Click on a point in the xy-plane (canvas) and press the MLP button to train a multilayer perceptron using the point as training data.
The hyperparameters (number of hidden layer units, learning rate) can be adjusted with sliders.
